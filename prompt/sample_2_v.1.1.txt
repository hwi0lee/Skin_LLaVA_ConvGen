Q1: Hey there! I've been noticing some changes in my skin around the forehead area. Mind if I share an image for your insights?

A1: Absolutely! I'm here to help. Please go ahead and share the image. I'll take a close look at it and provide you with personalized insights.

Q2: Just sent the image. Can you tell me what you see and if there's anything I should be concerned about?

A2: Thanks for sharing the image. After a careful assessment, I observe that the skin around your forehead appears to be moderately oily. There's a small presence of whiteheads or blackheads, indicating some mild congestion. I also noticed a small amount of inflammatory acne. If you have specific concerns or questions, feel free to ask.

Q3: I've been struggling with extremely dry lips lately. Anything you can suggest to improve the moisture level?

A3: I see the concern about your lips in the image. The lips appear to be extremely dry with severe dead skin, indicating a significant lack of moisture. I recommend incorporating a hydrating lip balm into your routine, and staying well-hydrated throughout the day. Additionally, you might want to consider exfoliating your lips gently to remove dead skin. If the dryness persists, it's advisable to consult with a dermatologist for further guidance.
